# Debugging Models

## Error Analysis in Debugging Machine Learning Models

### Overview

Error analysis is a critical step in the machine learning development pipeline. It involves systematically examining the mistakes a model makes to gain insights into potential areas for improvement. Instead of relying solely on aggregate metrics like accuracy or F1 score, error analysis dives into *what kinds of errors* are being made and *why*.

### Why Error Analysis Matters

- Helps identify whether the model's performance issues are due to data, labeling, model architecture, or other factors.
- Enables prioritization of development effort. Instead of arbitrarily tuning hyperparameters, you can target high-impact failure modes.
- Offers transparency and builds trust by showing how and why the model fails.

### Key Steps in Error Analysis

### 1. Categorize Errors

Split the model's predictions into **True Positives (TP)**, **True Negatives (TN)**, **False Positives (FP)**, and **False Negatives (FN)**. These can be analyzed to understand class-specific performance.

### 2. Slice the Data

Segment the dataset using features such as:

- Input length
- Domain or category
- Class labels
- Confidence score ranges
- Time (e.g., concept drift)

Example:
```python
errors = X_test[(y_pred != y_test)]
long_inputs = errors[errors["text"].apply(lambda x: len(x.split()) > 100)]
```


### 3. Analyze Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix provides a visual breakdown of predictions by actual vs. predicted class. It is especially useful in multiclass classification.

### 4. Inspect High-Loss Examples
In models that return probabilities or log-likelihoods, focus on the instances with the highest loss values. These are where the model is most confidently wrong.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Review
Have domain experts inspect a random sample of errors to identify patterns that are not immediately obvious through metrics or code.

#### Sample Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample predictions
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0])

# Analyze classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()

# Create a dataframe for manual error inspection
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "true": y_true,
    "pred": y_pred,
    "error": y_true != y_pred
})

print("\nIncorrect Predictions:")
print(df[df["error"] == True])
```

### Best Practices
Balance quantitative and qualitative inspection: Combine metrics with manual review.

Focus on high-impact errors: A rare misclassification may be less important than a frequently repeated one.

Be systematic: Tag and categorize errors for pattern recognition.

Automate what you can: Reproducibility matters when your model is evolving over time.

### Tools and Libraries

Some useful tools for error analysis:

scikit-learn – Metrics, confusion matrices

pandas – Filtering and grouping data

seaborn – Visualizing confusion matrices

What-If Tool – Interactive error inspection (TensorFlow)

alibi-detect – Drift and outlier detection

### Summary
Error analysis is not just a debugging step, it's a methodology to uncover what your model does not understand. By inspecting where and why your model fails, you make more informed decisions, which leads to better models and better outcomes.


## Model Overview in Debugging Machine Learning Models

### Overview

Understanding the model you're debugging is the foundational step in the debugging process. A **model overview** involves inspecting the architecture, training configuration, and the general performance of a machine learning model before diving into detailed diagnostics. It helps set expectations and quickly rules out broad categories of potential failure (e.g., underfitting, overfitting, data leakage, misconfiguration).



### Objectives of Model Overview

- **Verify model architecture**: Ensure that the model is structured correctly and suitable for the task (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Understand training setup**: Review hyperparameters, optimizer, loss function, and training duration.
- **Assess high-level performance**: Use metrics like accuracy, loss curves, or AUC to determine if the model has learned anything useful.
- **Check for red flags**: Look for signs of data leakage, extreme class imbalance, or training instability.
- **Establish a baseline**: Record initial metrics and assumptions for future comparison after debugging or tuning.


### Key Components

### 1. Model Architecture

Understand the model type, layers, and number of parameters.

- Is the model appropriate for the task?
- Are there too many or too few layers/parameters?

### 2. Hyperparameters

Review learning rate, batch size, optimizer type, dropout, regularization, etc.

### 3. Training and Validation Curves

Plot loss and/or accuracy per epoch for both training and validation sets to identify overfitting or underfitting.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

Report appropriate metrics for the task:

- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC
- Regression: MSE, MAE, R² Score

### 5. Dataset Summary

Include information about:

- Dataset size and split
- Class distribution
- Input feature statistics (mean, std, missing values)



### Sample Code

Below is a PyTorch-based example that shows how to log key model overview details:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchsummary import summary
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example Model
class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(SimpleMLP, self).__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

# Initialize model
model = SimpleMLP(input_dim=100, hidden_dim=64, output_dim=2)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

# Model summary
summary(model, input_size=(1, 100))

# Dummy training loop (for illustration)
train_loss_history = [0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4]
val_loss_history = [0.95, 0.8, 0.6, 0.55]

# Plot training and validation loss
plt.plot(train_loss_history, label="Train Loss")
plt.plot(val_loss_history, label="Validation Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epoch")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.title("Training/Validation Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Evaluate on dummy data
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Data Analysis in Debugging Machine Learning Models

### Overview

Data analysis is one of the most important and often overlooked steps in debugging machine learning models. Many model issues stem from the data itself—whether it's poor quality, incorrect labels, missing values, data leakage, or distribution mismatches. Before tuning models or adjusting architectures, it's critical to deeply understand the dataset you are working with.



### Objectives of Data Analysis

- Validate dataset integrity and structure
- Identify class imbalance or label noise
- Detect missing values or data type mismatches
- Check for data leakage or data overlap between train/test sets
- Explore feature distributions and correlations
- Understand relationships between input features and target variable



### Key Steps in Data Analysis

### 1. Inspect Dataset Structure

Verify the number of samples, features, data types, and null values.

Questions to ask:
- Are there unexpected nulls or unusual data types?
- Are categorical variables properly encoded?
- Are numerical features scaled appropriately?

### 2. Summary Statistics

Use `.describe()` for numerical data and `.value_counts()` for categorical data.

### 3. Visualize Distributions

Use histograms, box plots, and density plots to analyze the distribution of features.

### 4. Analyze Class Balance

In classification problems, check the target variable's distribution. Severe imbalance can cause biased models.

### 5. Check for Data Leakage

Ensure that no feature unintentionally leaks information about the target. Also verify proper separation of train and test data.

### 6. Examine Feature Correlations

Use correlation matrices to check relationships between features and target variable.

### 7. Identify Outliers

Outliers can significantly skew training. Use box plots, z-scores, or interquartile range (IQR) to identify and analyze them.


### Sample Code

Below is an example using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for analyzing a classification dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# 1. Inspect structure
print("Shape:", df.shape)
print("\nData Types:\n", df.dtypes)
print("\nNull Values:\n", df.isnull().sum())

# 2. Summary statistics
print("\nSummary Statistics:\n", df.describe())

# 3. Class distribution (for classification tasks)
print("\nTarget Class Distribution:\n", df['target'].value_counts(normalize=True))

# 4. Visualize feature distributions
num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns

for col in num_cols:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))
    sns.histplot(df[col], bins=30, kde=True)
    plt.title(f"Distribution of {col}")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# 5. Correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap="coolwarm", mask=np.triu(corr))
plt.title("Feature Correlation Matrix")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# 6. Detect outliers using IQR
def detect_outliers_iqr(data, column):
    Q1 = data[column].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = data[column].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers = data[(data[column] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data[column] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
    return outliers

outlier_examples = detect_outliers_iqr(df, 'feature_column')
print(f"\nDetected {len(outlier_examples)} outliers in 'feature_column'")
```

### Common Issues Identified Through Data Analysis

| Observation                                      | Potential Problem                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing values in key features                  | Indicates data quality issues or incomplete records             |
| Skewed class distribution                        | May lead to biased predictions, especially in classification    |
| Identical or overlapping rows in train/test     | Suggests data leakage or improper dataset splitting             |

### Summary
Thorough data analysis is essential for building reliable machine learning models. It helps detect early issues in the pipeline that may otherwise surface as subtle bugs during model training or evaluation. A well-understood dataset lays the foundation for informed model development and effective debugging.

## Feature Importance in Debugging Machine Learning Models

### Overview

Understanding which features drive model predictions is essential in debugging machine learning models. **Feature importance** refers to techniques that assign scores to input features based on how useful they are at predicting the target variable. This helps in identifying redundant, irrelevant, or misleading features and diagnosing issues such as overfitting, data leakage, or unstable model behavior.



### Objectives of Feature Importance Analysis

- Identify which features contribute most to model performance
- Detect irrelevant or redundant features that could be removed
- Surface potential data leakage if target-correlated features dominate
- Understand model decision behavior and improve interpretability
- Validate domain assumptions and feature engineering choices


### When to Use Feature Importance

- After initial model training to interpret model decisions
- When model performance is unexpectedly high or low
- When debugging overfitting or underfitting
- During feature selection or dimensionality reduction
- Before deploying a model to validate explainability


### Common Methods for Measuring Feature Importance

| Method                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coefficients (Linear Models) | Magnitude of weights indicates importance                                  |
| Tree-based Feature Importance | Based on feature usage frequency and information gain in splits           |
| Permutation Importance     | Measures drop in performance when a feature is randomly shuffled           |
| SHAP (SHapley Values)      | Assigns each feature a contribution value for individual predictions        |
| LIME                       | Local approximation of feature effects on single predictions                |



### Sample Code: Tree-Based and Permutation Importance

Below is an example using `RandomForestClassifier` and `permutation_importance` from `scikit-learn`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load example dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()
X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(data.target)

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Feature importance from the model (Gini importance)
importances = model.feature_importances_
feature_names = X.columns

# Plot tree-based importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sorted_idx = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]
plt.bar(range(len(importances)), importances[sorted_idx])
plt.xticks(range(len(importances)), feature_names[sorted_idx], rotation=90)
plt.title("Feature Importance (Tree-based)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Permutation importance
perm_result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=10, random_state=42)

# Plot permutation importance
sorted_idx = perm_result.importances_mean.argsort()[::-1]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(range(len(sorted_idx)), perm_result.importances_mean[sorted_idx])
plt.xticks(range(len(sorted_idx)), X.columns[sorted_idx], rotation=90)
plt.title("Feature Importance (Permutation)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```





### Interpreting Feature Importance Results

| Observation                                          | Possible Implication                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Few features dominate the score                      | Model may be overly reliant on a small subset of features; check for data leakage     |
| Many features have similar low importance scores     | Model may be underfitting or features could be redundant or noisy                     |
| Domain-relevant feature has low importance           | Feature may be poorly encoded, contain missing values, or not well represented        |
| Feature rankings change significantly between runs   | Model may be unstable; check data size, randomness, or multicollinearity              |
| Highly correlated features have lower individual scores | Importance is diluted among correlated features; consider dimensionality reduction  |
| Features with high importance but no domain relevance | Possible data leakage or model overfitting to artifacts in the data                   |

### Best Practices
Always validate feature importance results across multiple runs or folds

Use both global (e.g., tree importance) and local (e.g., SHAP) methods for better understanding

Combine importance with correlation and domain knowledge before removing features

Be cautious with highly correlated features, importance may be shared or diluted

### Tools and Libraries
scikit-learn – Tree-based and permutation importance

eli5 – Permutation importance and weights

shap – SHAP values for global and local explanations

lime – Local interpretability

### Summary
Feature importance analysis plays a critical role in debugging and understanding machine learning models. It helps ensure that models are not only accurate but also trustworthy and explainable. By identifying which inputs the model depends on, you can validate your pipeline, reduce complexity, and improve generalization.
