# Real World Applications

## Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is a binary classification task in which machine learning is used to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal transactions, making this a highly imbalanced classification problem.

## Problem Definition

- **Objective**: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- **Classes**:
  - Class 0: Legitimate
  - Class 1: Fraudulent
- **Challenges**:
  - Class imbalance (fraud cases are very few)
  - High cost of false negatives (missing a fraud)
  - Need for real-time or near real-time prediction



## Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess features
3. Handle class imbalance
4. Train a model
5. Evaluate performance

---

## 1: Load and Explore the Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')

# Basic shape and class distribution
print("Shape:", data.shape)
print("Class distribution:")
print(data['Class'].value_counts())

```


## 2: Preprocess the Data

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Normalize the 'Amount' column
data['Amount'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data[['Amount']])

# Drop the 'Time' column (optional)
data.drop('Time', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Separate features and target
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
```

## 3: Handle Class Imbalance
Option A: Undersampling

```python

# Separate fraud and non-fraud
fraud = data[data['Class'] == 1]
non_fraud = data[data['Class'] == 0].sample(n=len(fraud), random_state=42)

# Combine into a balanced dataset
balanced_data = pd.concat([fraud, non_fraud])

X_bal = balanced_data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y_bal = balanced_data['Class']

```

Option B: SMOTE Oversampling





```python

from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Train-test split on original imbalanced data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE
sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_res, y_train_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

```


## 4: Train the Model
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Use undersampled or SMOTE-resampled data as input
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_res, y_train_res)
```


## 5: Evaluate the Model

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

```

### Summary
Credit card fraud detection is a rare event detection problem.

Preprocessing and class balancing (undersampling or SMOTE) are essential.

Random Forest is a strong baseline model for tabular data.

Performance should be evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, especially for the fraud class.

## Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning

Bias in machine learning (ML) refers to systematic errors that result in unfair outcomes, such as preferring one group over another. These biases can be introduced through data collection, model design, or deployment processes. Bias mitigation is critical in building fair, ethical, and legally compliant AI systems.

## Types of Bias

- **Historical Bias**: Embedded in the dataset due to past societal inequalities.
- **Sampling Bias**: Caused by non-representative data collection.
- **Measurement Bias**: Occurs when the features used to train the model inaccurately represent the real-world attributes.
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Arises from model assumptions and training processes.

## General Bias Mitigation Strategies

Bias mitigation can occur at three stages:

### 1. Pre-processing (Before Training)

- **Re-sampling**: Balance the dataset (e.g., oversample minority classes).
- **Reweighting**: Assign different weights to samples to counteract imbalance.
- **Data augmentation**: Generate synthetic examples for underrepresented groups.

### 2. In-processing (During Training)

- **Fairness constraints**: Modify loss functions to penalize unfairness.
- **Adversarial debiasing**: Train a model while trying to remove group information via adversaries.

### 3. Post-processing (After Training)

- **Equalized odds post-processing**: Adjust the model's predictions to equalize performance metrics across groups.
- **Thresholding**: Apply different decision thresholds per group.

## Example: Mitigating Bias with Reweighing (Pre-processing)

We will use the `Adult` dataset from the UCI repository. The target is whether an individual earns more than $50K/year. We will mitigate gender bias.

### Dependencies

```python
!pip install fairlearn scikit-learn pandas numpy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame, selection_rate, demographic_parity_difference

# Load dataset
data = fetch_openml(data_id=1590, as_frame=True)  # Adult dataset
df = data.frame

# Basic preprocessing
df = df.dropna()
X = df.drop('class', axis=1)
y = (df['class'] == '>50K').astype(int)

# Encode categorical variables
X_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)
y = y.reset_index(drop=True)

# Sensitive feature: sex
A = X['sex'].reset_index(drop=True)

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, A_train, A_test = train_test_split(
    X_encoded, y, A, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Baseline model without mitigation
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Bias metrics (without mitigation)
mf = MetricFrame(metrics=selection_rate, y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=A_test)
print("Selection rates (no mitigation):")
print(mf.by_group)

print("Demographic Parity Difference (no mitigation):")
print(demographic_parity_difference(y_test, y_pred, sensitive_features=A_test))

# Fair model with mitigation (Exponentiated Gradient)
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(
    estimator=LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'),
    constraints=DemographicParity(),
    eps=0.01
)

mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=A_train)
y_pred_fair = mitigator.predict(X_test)

# Bias metrics (with mitigation)
mf_fair = MetricFrame(metrics=selection_rate, y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred_fair, sensitive_features=A_test)
print("\nSelection rates (with mitigation):")
print(mf_fair.by_group)

print("Demographic Parity Difference (with mitigation):")
print(demographic_parity_difference(y_test, y_pred_fair, sensitive_features=A_test))

# Accuracy comparison
print("\nAccuracy (no mitigation):", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy (with mitigation):", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_fair))
```

## Key Takeaways
The ExponentiatedGradient method with a DemographicParity constraint aims to equalize the selection rate across groups (in this case, male and female).

You can compare selection rates and demographic parity differences before and after mitigation.

Fairness often introduces a trade-off with accuracy. Evaluate both metrics carefully in production systems.

## Tools for Bias Mitigation
Fairlearn – Algorithms for fairness constraints and metrics.

AIF360 – IBM's comprehensive fairness toolkit.

What-If Tool – Interactive visual debugging for fairness.

## Summary
Bias in machine learning can originate from data, algorithms, or measurement processes. It often results in unequal model performance or treatment across sensitive groups like gender or race. To address this, bias mitigation techniques can be applied at various stages of the ML pipeline:

In pre-processing, data can be reweighted or rebalanced.

During in-processing, constraints can enforce fairness objectives.

In post-processing, outputs can be adjusted to meet equity metrics.

This example demonstrates how to detect and reduce demographic disparity using the Fairlearn library. The technique balances fairness (equal selection rates between genders) against model accuracy. Monitoring and mitigating bias is essential for developing responsible, trustworthy AI systems.


## Personalizing the Customer Journey Using Machine Learning

Personalizing the customer journey means tailoring content, recommendations, and interactions to individual users based on their preferences, behavior, and history. Machine learning (ML) plays a central role in achieving this by learning patterns from customer data and predicting next-best actions, products, or messages.

## Why Personalization Matters

- Increases customer engagement and satisfaction
- Boosts conversions and revenue
- Reduces churn by enhancing relevance
- Supports scalable automation for digital marketing and UX

## Key Stages of the Customer Journey for Personalization

1. **Awareness** – Personalized ads or blog content based on browsing history
2. **Consideration** – Dynamic recommendations, product comparisons
3. **Purchase** – Customized discounts, urgency triggers
4. **Retention** – Email targeting, upsell/cross-sell offers
5. **Loyalty** – Reward systems, anniversary campaigns

## Machine Learning Techniques for Personalization

| Technique             | Use Case                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Collaborative Filtering | Product recommendations (based on user-user or item-item similarities) |
| Content-Based Filtering | Recommend similar products based on features |
| Clustering (e.g., KMeans) | Customer segmentation |
| Classification (e.g., XGBoost) | Churn prediction, email response prediction |
| Reinforcement Learning | Adaptive offers or UX flow optimization |

## Example: Personalized Product Recommendations Using Collaborative Filtering

We will implement a basic **collaborative filtering** model using matrix factorization (SVD) to recommend products to users.

### Dependencies

```python
!pip install scikit-surprise pandas
import pandas as pd
from surprise import Dataset, Reader, SVD
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise.accuracy import rmse

# Sample user-product interaction data
data_dict = {
    'user_id': ['U1', 'U1', 'U1', 'U2', 'U2', 'U3', 'U3', 'U3', 'U3'],
    'product_id': ['P1', 'P2', 'P3', 'P1', 'P4', 'P2', 'P3', 'P4', 'P5'],
    'rating': [5, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)

# Define reader for Surprise library
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['user_id', 'product_id', 'rating']], reader)

# Train/test split
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering
model = SVD()
model.fit(trainset)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.test(testset)
print("RMSE:", rmse(predictions))

# Recommend top-N items for a given user
def get_top_n(predictions, n=3):
    from collections import defaultdict
    top_n = defaultdict(list)
    for uid, iid, true_r, est, _ in predictions:
        top_n[uid].append((iid, est))
    for uid, user_ratings in top_n.items():
        user_ratings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        top_n[uid] = user_ratings[:n]
    return top_n

# Predict for all user-item pairs not in the training set
trainset_iids = set(iid for (_, iid, _) in trainset.all_ratings())
all_items = set(df['product_id'].unique())

testset_full = []
for user in df['user_id'].unique():
    for item in all_items:
        if not trainset.knows_item(trainset.to_inner_iid(item)) or not trainset.knows_user(trainset.to_inner_uid(user)):
            continue
        if item not in [iid for (iid, _) in trainset.ur[trainset.to_inner_uid(user)]]:
            testset_full.append((user, item, 0))

predictions_full = model.test(testset_full)
top_n = get_top_n(predictions_full, n=2)

print("\nTop Recommendations:")
for user_id, recs in top_n.items():
    print(f"{user_id}: {[item for item, _ in recs]}")

```

## Interpreting the Results
The model predicts how much a user would like an unseen product based on their and others' past interactions.

We return the top-N recommendations for each user not already seen in the training data.

RMSE (root mean squared error) is used to evaluate the model’s prediction accuracy.

## Extensions for Real-World Use
Integrate with real-time streaming data pipelines.

Combine collaborative and content-based approaches for hybrid recommendation systems.

Include contextual factors like time of day, device, or location.

Use customer segmentation (e.g., KMeans) to personalize email campaigns or landing pages.

Apply reinforcement learning for adaptive personalization based on rewards (clicks, purchases).

## Summary
Personalizing the customer journey with machine learning helps businesses tailor interactions to individual needs, driving better user experience and business outcomes. Techniques like collaborative filtering enable product recommendations based on user behavior, while classification and clustering assist with customer segmentation and churn prediction. In production, these models can be integrated with CRM systems, websites, or marketing platforms to provide dynamic, personalized experiences at scale.



## Inventory Management Using Machine Learning

Inventory management involves tracking stock levels, demand forecasting, reordering, and optimizing supply chain decisions. Traditional methods rely on rule-based systems or fixed models, but machine learning (ML) brings data-driven accuracy and adaptability.

## Why Use Machine Learning for Inventory Management?

- Reduces overstocking and understocking
- Improves demand forecasting accuracy
- Minimizes holding and shortage costs
- Adapts to seasonality, trends, and external factors
- Enables real-time and dynamic decision making

## Core ML Use Cases in Inventory Management

| ML Task              | Use Case                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Supervised Regression | Forecast product demand for future dates            |
| Classification        | Predict stock-out risk or order delay               |
| Time Series Forecasting | Capture seasonality and trends in item sales      |
| Clustering            | Group products or stores by demand patterns         |
| Reinforcement Learning | Optimize ordering policies under uncertainty       |

---

## Example: Demand Forecasting with Time Series Regression

This example uses historical sales data to forecast future demand for a single product using a supervised learning model (Random Forest).

### Dependencies

```python
!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated daily sales data
np.random.seed(42)
days = pd.date_range(start="2022-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "date": days,
    "sales": (20 + 5 * np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, len(days))) +
              np.random.normal(0, 2, len(days))).round().astype(int)
})

# Feature engineering
data['day_of_week'] = data['date'].dt.dayofweek
data['month'] = data['date'].dt.month
data['day_of_month'] = data['date'].dt.day
data['lag_1'] = data['sales'].shift(1)
data['lag_7'] = data['sales'].shift(7)
data['rolling_mean_7'] = data['sales'].rolling(window=7).mean()
data = data.dropna()

# Train/test split
features = ['day_of_week', 'month', 'day_of_month', 'lag_1', 'lag_7', 'rolling_mean_7']
X = data[features]
y = data['sales']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, shuffle=False, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("RMSE:", round(rmse, 2))

# Plot actual vs predicted
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(data['date'][-len(y_test):], y_test.values, label="Actual")
plt.plot(data['date'][-len(y_test):], y_pred, label="Predicted")
plt.title("Demand Forecasting (Random Forest)")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Interpretation
The model uses lag features and calendar-based features to learn from past sales patterns.

RandomForestRegressor handles non-linearity and interactions well without much preprocessing.

The RMSE metric evaluates the prediction error on the test set.

## Real-World Extensions
Use multi-variate features like promotions, weather, pricing, holidays.

Model at the SKU + location level for granular predictions.

Integrate with inventory replenishment systems for automated ordering.

Apply probabilistic forecasting (e.g., quantile regression) for safety stock estimation.

Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM or Temporal Fusion Transformer) for high-volume, multi-SKU forecasting.

## Summary
Machine learning enhances inventory management by accurately forecasting demand, detecting anomalies, and optimizing replenishment. In this example, a Random Forest model predicted future sales using lagged and calendar features. With enough historical data and contextual signals, ML-based inventory systems can significantly reduce stockouts, cut excess inventory, and improve supply chain efficiency.


## Managing Clinical Trials Using Machine Learning

Clinical trials are essential to validating the safety and efficacy of new drugs, devices, or therapies. Managing them involves complex planning, patient recruitment, monitoring, and data analysis. Machine learning (ML) introduces intelligent automation and predictive insights to improve trial design, execution, and outcomes.

```

## Interpreting the Results
Classification Report gives precision, recall, F1-score — useful for assessing how well the model predicts patient dropout.

Confusion Matrix shows true positives, false positives, and so on.

Feature Importance shows which attributes most influence dropout — this insight can guide clinical staff to improve retention (e.g., addressing travel burden or low compliance scores).


## Real-World Applications
Automated Screening: Use ML to filter eligible patients by scanning EHR data.

Adaptive Trial Design: Adjust dosage or enrollment dynamically based on model feedback.

Risk-Based Monitoring: Prioritize monitoring resources to high-risk sites or participants.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extract critical endpoints or adverse events from unstructured text.

Synthetic Control Arms: Reduce control group size by augmenting with historical patient data modeled using ML.

## Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
Ensure models are interpretable and clinically validated.

Maintain compliance with GCP, HIPAA, and GDPR.

Bias and fairness must be evaluated, especially in sensitive patient inclusion/exclusion decisions.

Explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME) is crucial for clinician trust and regulatory approval.

## Summary
Machine learning can streamline clinical trial management by improving recruitment, forecasting outcomes, and reducing risk. In this example, a Random Forest model predicted dropout risk using patient attributes, helping sponsors and clinicians proactively retain participants. With proper validation and ethical safeguards, ML can significantly accelerate and de-risk clinical research.

## Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

### Introduction

Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news, often with the intention to deceive. It has become a critical problem in the digital age, especially with the rise of social media platforms where content can spread rapidly and widely.

The detection of fake news is challenging due to the subtlety of misinformation, stylistic similarities between real and fake news, and the volume of content produced every day. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to new patterns. Machine learning offers a scalable, data-driven approach to identifying fake news by learning linguistic patterns, semantic features, and source credibility from large datasets.


### Importance of Fake News Detection

- **Prevents misinformation spread** on social media, news outlets, and blogs.
- **Protects public opinion** from being influenced by biased or misleading content.
- **Aids digital platforms** in moderating harmful or manipulative articles.
- **Supports fact-checking organizations** by automating content screening.



### Techniques Used in Machine Learning

Fake news detection typically uses supervised learning with a labeled dataset (real vs fake). Some key techniques include:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and feature extraction from text.
- **Text Classification Models**: Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble methods.
- **Deep Learning**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and Transformers like BERT for contextual analysis.
- **Vectorization Methods**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Word2Vec, GloVe, or embeddings from pretrained models.
- **Metadata Analysis**: Domain reputation, publication time, author information.



### Data Sources

To train fake news detection models, datasets typically contain labeled articles and headlines. Common datasets include:

- LIAR dataset: Short statements labeled with truth ratings.
- FakeNewsNet: Full articles with metadata.
- Kaggle’s Fake News Dataset: Labeled news articles with title and text.


### Pipeline for Fake News Detection

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping or using publicly available datasets.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text (lowercasing, stopwords removal, punctuation stripping).
3. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, or pretrained embeddings.
4. **Model Training**: Using ML models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Deployment**: Integrating the model into web applications or news platforms for real-time detection.



### Code Example: Fake News Detection with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

### 1. Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
```

### 2. Load Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv('fake_news_dataset.csv')  # columns: 'text', 'label'
df = df.dropna()
```

### 3. Prepare Features and Labels
```python
X = df['text']
y = df['label']
```

### 4. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
```

### 5. Transform Text Using TF-IDF
```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_df=0.7)
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
```

### 6. Train Logistic Regression Model
```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
```

### 7. Evaluate Model
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### 8. Predict New Sample

Machine learning in museums encompasses computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems, and more. These technologies allow museums to become more interactive, data-driven, and inclusive, offering personalized and immersive experiences for both on-site and online visitors.



### Applications of Machine Learning in Museums

### 1. Art and Artifact Classification

Museums often house thousands to millions of artifacts. Manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone. ML models can be trained to classify images of paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and more into categories such as period, style, artist, material, or cultural origin.

### 2. Image Recognition and Metadata Generation

Computer vision techniques help recognize objects or features in artworks or photographs. ML models can automatically generate or verify metadata for images, identify missing pieces of documentation, and support digitization projects.

### 3. Visitor Personalization and Recommendation Systems

Just like streaming platforms recommend content, ML can recommend exhibits, tours, or content to visitors based on preferences, past behavior, or interest profiles. These systems improve visitor satisfaction and engagement.

### 4. Sentiment and Feedback Analysis

NLP-based models can analyze visitor feedback, survey responses, social media comments, or online reviews to extract insights into visitor satisfaction, emotional response to exhibits, and areas of improvement.

### 5. Restoration and Preservation Assistance

ML models can assist with virtual restoration of damaged or missing artworks, suggest cleaning methods based on material identification, or monitor environmental conditions to predict deterioration.

### 6. Automated Transcription and Translation

For museums with historical documents, ML-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and translation systems can digitize and translate texts across languages, making them accessible to broader audiences.


### Datasets Often Used

- Internal digitized museum archives
- Public art datasets (e.g., WikiArt, Google Arts & Culture)
- Metadata repositories (e.g., Europeana, Smithsonian Open Access)
- Visitor interaction logs (e.g., mobile app usage, QR code scans)
- Surveys, reviews, and social media texts



### Machine Learning Techniques Involved

- **Computer Vision**: For object recognition, classification, style transfer
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For metadata generation, feedback analysis, language translation
- **Recommendation Systems**: For personalized tours and content suggestions
- **Time Series Analysis**: For tracking footfall trends, predicting exhibit popularity
- **Clustering & Topic Modeling**: For exhibit theming or unsupervised grouping of artifacts


## Sample Code: Artwork Classification Using a Pretrained CNN

This example uses a simple convolutional neural network to classify images of artworks into categories (e.g., Baroque, Impressionism, Cubism).

### 1. Import Required Libraries

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import os
```

```python
train_dir = 'museum_dataset/train'
val_dir = 'museum_dataset/val'

train_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
val_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

train_data = train_gen.flow_from_directory(train_dir, target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')
val_data = val_gen.flow_from_directory(val_dir, target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')
```


### 3. Load Pretrained Model and Add Custom Layers

```python
base_model = MobileNetV2(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
base_model.trainable = False

model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(train_data.num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```


### 4. Compile and Train the Model

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_data, epochs=5, validation_data=val_data)
```


### 5. Predict on New Artwork Image

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

img_path = 'new_artwork.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

prediction = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = train_data.class_indices
predicted_label = list(predicted_class.keys())[np.argmax(prediction)]
print("Predicted Art Style:", predicted_label)
```

### Example Use Cases
The Metropolitan Museum of Art uses AI to make digital collections searchable and recommends similar works.

The Rijksmuseum applies image recognition to organize artworks and help with automatic tagging.

## Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

### Introduction

Customer segmentation is a foundational task in marketing and business strategy. It involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics. This allows organizations to tailor products, services, marketing campaigns, and communications to specific segments, increasing relevance and effectiveness.

Machine learning enhances customer segmentation by enabling businesses to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior and automatically group them using data-driven approaches. Unlike traditional segmentation methods based on demographics alone, ML can process complex behavioral and transactional data to form dynamic and nuanced customer clusters.

In this guide, we explore how machine learning is used for customer segmentation, including the business value it provides, common techniques used, types of data involved, and a complete working example using Python.



### Benefits of Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

- **Improved Marketing Efficiency**: Targeted campaigns lead to higher conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs.
- **Personalized Customer Experiences**: Custom recommendations, pricing, and services improve customer satisfaction.
- **Retention and Loyalty**: Identifying high-value customers helps prioritize retention efforts.
- **Product Development**: Insights into customer preferences inform the design of new products.
- **Cross-sell and Upsell Opportunities**: Grouping customers by buying behavior reveals revenue growth areas.


### Types of Customer Segmentation

- **Demographic**: Age, gender, income, education
- **Geographic**: Location, climate, region
- **Psychographic**: Lifestyle, values, interests
- **Behavioral**: Purchase frequency, loyalty, website interaction, product preferences
- **Transactional**: Average spend, order frequency, product types purchased

Machine learning is especially powerful in behavioral and transactional segmentation, where traditional rule-based systems fall short.


### Common Machine Learning Techniques for Segmentation

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Groups customers into `k` clusters based on feature similarity.
  - **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering that can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and outliers.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree of clusters using a bottom-up or top-down approach.
  - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Soft clustering using probability distributions.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces features while retaining the most informative components.
  - **t-SNE** or **UMAP**: Often used for visualization of high-dimensional customer data.


### Sample Code: Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This example uses synthetic customer data including annual income and spending score to perform K-Means clustering.

### 1. Import Libraries and Load Data

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Sample dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Mall_Customers.csv')
df = data[['Annual Income (k$)', 'Spending Score (1-100)']]
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_df = scaler.fit_transform(df)
```

### 3. Find Optimal Number of Clusters Using Elbow Method
```python
wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(scaled_df)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o')
plt.title('Elbow Method')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 4. Train K-Means with Optimal Cluster Count
```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_df)
data['Cluster'] = clusters
```

### 5. Visualize Clusters
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
for c in range(5):
    plt.scatter(data[data['Cluster'] == c]['Annual Income (k$)'],
                data[data['Cluster'] == c]['Spending Score (1-100)'],
                label=f'Cluster {c}')

plt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.title('Customer Segments')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 6. Optional: Use PCA for Visualizing Higher Dimensional Segments
```python
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_data = pca.fit_transform(scaled_df)
plt.scatter(pca_data[:, 0], pca_data[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='rainbow')
plt.title('PCA - Customer Segments')
plt.xlabel('PCA 1')
plt.ylabel('PCA 2')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```


### Real-World Applications
Retail and E-commerce: Segment customers into high spenders, discount-seekers, or frequent buyers.

Banking and Finance: Group customers by investment behavior or credit risk.

Travel and Hospitality: Segment travelers based on booking frequency, location, and spend.

Healthcare: Group patients by insurance claims, appointment behavior, and treatment history.

Telecommunications: Classify users based on call, data usage, churn behavior.


### Summary
Customer segmentation using machine learning enables organizations to analyze large, diverse customer datasets to uncover hidden patterns and actionable insights. By grouping customers with similar behaviors or characteristics, businesses can improve targeting, increase ROI on marketing efforts, enhance customer experience, and build long-term loyalty.

Techniques such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models allow companies to move beyond traditional segmentation based on demographics alone. Combined with modern visualization tools and dimensionality reduction techniques, customer segmentation becomes an integral part of intelligent customer relationship management.

Machine learning empowers businesses to transition from static, assumption-based segmentation to dynamic, data-driven strategies that evolve with their customer base.
