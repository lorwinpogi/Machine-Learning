# Simulation Environment 

## What is a Simulation Environment?

A **simulation environment** in machine learning is a virtual world or system where agents (typically controlled by algorithms) can interact with a simulated environment to learn and make decisions. It is commonly used in:

- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Game AI development
- Operations research
- Control systems

These environments provide controlled, repeatable scenarios where models can be trained and evaluated safely and efficiently.

## Key Components of a Simulation Environment

1. **Agent**  
   The entity (model) that takes actions based on the environment's state.

2. **Environment**  
   The system in which the agent operates. It returns an observation, reward, and sometimes a done flag.

3. **State**  
   A snapshot of the environment at a given time.

4. **Action**  
   A move made by the agent that can change the state of the environment.

5. **Reward**  
   A signal from the environment used to evaluate the agent's action.

6. **Episode**  
   A sequence of states, actions, and rewards ending in a terminal state.

Agents communicate via a gRPC interface between Unity and Python.


Custom Simulation Environment (Using gym.Env)
You can create your own environment by subclassing gym.Env.

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces
import numpy as np

class CustomEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomEnv, self).__init__()
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=10, shape=(1,))
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(2)

    def reset(self):
        self.state = np.array([5])
        return self.state

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0:
            self.state -= 1
        else:
            self.state += 1

        reward = 1.0 if self.state == 10 else -0.1
        done = bool(self.state >= 10 or self.state <= 0)

        return self.state, reward, done, {}

    def render(self):
        print(f"Current State: {self.state}")
```


## Agent in Simulation Environment (Machine Learning with Python)


In machine learning—particularly in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and simulation environments—an **Agent** is an entity that **interacts with an environment** by:

1. **Observing** the current state
2. **Taking actions** based on a policy
3. **Receiving rewards** or penalties
4. **Learning** from experience to improve its future performance

The agent's goal is typically to **maximize cumulative reward** over time.



## Core Responsibilities of an Agent

- **Perceive** the environment (observe the state)
- **Decide** what action to take (policy or model)
- **Act** to change the state of the environment
- **Learn** from the results of its actions (through training)



## Agent-Environment Interaction Loop

The basic interaction between an agent and an environment follows this loop:

```text
1. Environment provides state (observation)
2. Agent selects an action
3. Environment transitions to new state
4. Agent receives a reward
5. Repeat...


## Types of Agents

1. **Random Agent**  
   Takes actions randomly, useful as a baseline.

2. **Rule-Based Agent**  
   Follows fixed if-else logic.

3. **Learning Agent**  
   Learns from experience using algorithms like:
   
   - **Q-Learning**
   - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
   - **Policy Gradient**
   - **Actor-Critic Methods**



**Agent Example in OpenAI Gym**
```python
import gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
obs = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    env.render()
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random Agent
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        obs = env.reset()

env.close()
```

**Building a Custom Agent Class**

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, action_space_size, state_space_size, learning_rate=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1.0, epsilon_decay=0.995):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((state_space_size, action_space_size))
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay
        self.action_space_size = action_space_size

    def select_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.randint(self.action_space_size)  # Explore
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])  # Exploit

    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        future_q = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])
        target = reward + self.gamma * future_q * (not done)
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.lr * (target - self.q_table[state, action])

        if done:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay

```

To use this agent:
```python
env = gym.make("Taxi-v3")
agent = QLearningAgent(env.action_space.n, env.observation_space.n)

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
```

## Environment 


In machine learning—particularly in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**—an **Environment** is the simulated world or system with which an agent interacts. It serves as the **interface** between the agent and the task that needs to be learned.

The environment:

- **Provides observations** to the agent (states)
- **Receives actions** from the agent
- **Returns rewards** and next states based on those actions
- **Determines when an episode ends**


## Components of an Environment

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Observation (State)** | The current situation of the environment, seen by the agent |
| **Action Space** | The set of all possible actions the agent can take |
| **Reward** | A signal returned after each action to guide learning |
| **Transition** | The change in state based on the agent’s action |
| **Episode** | A complete sequence from start to terminal state |


## Example: Environment Flow

Here’s a basic sequence of how an environment behaves:

```text
1. Environment is initialized (reset)
2. Environment gives initial state (observation)
3. Agent takes action
4. Environment returns:
   - next state
   - reward
   - done (is episode over?)
   - additional info (optional)
5. Repeat until done
```

### **Python Libraries for Simulation Environments**


### 1.  **OpenAI Gym**

```bash
pip install gym
```
```python
import gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
obs = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    env.render()
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        obs = env.reset()

env.close()
```

### 2.  **Custom Environments with gym.Env**
You can create your own environment by subclassing gym.Env and defining the following methods:

__init__(self)

reset(self)

step(self, action)

render(self, mode='human') (optional)

close(self) (optional)

Example:

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces
import numpy as np

class SimpleEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleEnv, self).__init__()
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=10, shape=(1,))
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(2)
        self.state = np.array([5])

    def reset(self):
        self.state = np.array([5])
        return self.state

    def step(self, action):
        if action == 0:
            self.state -= 1
        else:
            self.state += 1

        reward = 1 if self.state == 10 else -0.1
        done = bool(self.state <= 0 or self.state >= 10)

        return self.state, reward, done, {}

    def render(self, mode="human"):
        print(f"Current state: {self.state}")

```

Usage:

```python
env = SimpleEnv()
state = env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    env.render()
```


###  Types of Environments

- **Deterministic**  
  Same action in the same state always gives the same result.

- **Stochastic**  
  Actions can produce different outcomes even in the same state (adds realism).

- **Discrete vs Continuous**
  - **Discrete**: Limited set of actions/states.
  - **Continuous**: Actions and/or states are floats (e.g., robot arm control).

- **Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent**
  - **Single-Agent**: Most Gym environments are single-agent.
  - **Multi-Agent**: Used in games, robotics, and coordination problems.


### Summary

The **Environment** is the backbone of a simulation setup in machine learning. It:

- Defines the rules and dynamics of the system  
- Interfaces with the agent via observations and rewards  
- Can be reused, extended, or customized for different tasks  

Python libraries like **OpenAI Gym**, **PyBullet**, and **Unity ML-Agents** provide powerful environments for research and production-level machine learning applications.

##  State

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the concept of a **state** is central to how an agent perceives and interacts with its environment. A state provides the agent with the necessary information to make decisions and take actions.

A **state** represents the current situation or configuration of the environment from the agent’s perspective. It is essentially a snapshot of all the relevant variables at a given time.

In formal terms, the state is often denoted as:

s ∈ S


Where:
- `s` is the current **state**
- `S` is the **set of all possible states** (the state space)


## State Important?

The state allows the agent to:
- Understand **where it is** in the environment
- Decide **what action** to take next
- Receive **rewards** based on its actions
- Learn a **policy** for decision-making



## State in the Context of Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

Reinforcement learning problems are commonly modeled as **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**. In an MDP, the next state depends only on the **current state** and **action**, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This is known as the **Markov Property**.

**Markov Property:**
> The future is independent of the past given the present.

Formally:

P(sₜ₊₁ | s₀, a₀, s₁, a₁, ..., sₜ, aₜ) = P(sₜ₊₁ | sₜ, aₜ)


This simplifies the learning problem significantly.

---

### Types of States

There are typically two main ways states are represented:

### 1. **Fully Observable States**
- The agent has access to **all relevant information**.
- Common in environments like chess, where the entire board is visible.

### 2. **Partially Observable States**
- The agent only sees **part of the environment**.
- Common in real-world scenarios like robotics or video games.

---

###  Example: Grid World

Imagine a simple grid world where an agent moves in a 5x5 grid.

- Each position on the grid is a **state**.
- The agent can observe its current coordinates (e.g., `(3,2)`).
- Actions might include moving `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`.
- The goal is to reach a terminal state (like a goal cell).


###  State Representation

States can be represented in different ways depending on the problem:

- **Discrete State**: A finite set of values (e.g., positions in a grid)
- **Continuous State**: Real-valued vectors (e.g., velocity, angle, position in robotics)
- **Feature Vector**: High-dimensional representations (e.g., pixel values in images, sensor readings)



###  State Transitions

When an agent takes an action, the environment transitions to a **new state** based on a transition probability:


P(s′ | s, a)



Where:
- `s` = current state
- `a` = action taken
- `s′` = next state



###  Summary

- A **state** defines the agent’s current context within the environment.
- States are key to decision-making and learning optimal policies.
- The **Markov Property** ensures decisions depend only on the current state.
- States can be **discrete**, **continuous**, or **partially observable**.
- The design of the state space critically impacts the performance of RL algorithms.





## Action i

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an **action** represents a decision made by the agent that affects the environment. At each time step, the agent selects an action from a set of possible actions based on the current state, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over time.



An **action** is a move or choice the agent can make at a given state. Formally, actions belong to a set:

a ∈ A(s)


Where:
- `a` is an action
- `A(s)` is the set of all possible actions available from state `s`

The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maps states to actions in a way that maximizes expected long-term rewards.



### Types of Action Spaces

#### 1. Discrete Action Space

- The number of actions is finite.
- Common in environments like Grid World or games.
- Example: `A = {up, down, left, right}`

#### 2. Continuous Action Space

- Actions are represented by real numbers.
- Common in control systems and robotics.
- Example: steering angles or force values: `A ⊂ ℝ^n`


### Action Selection

The choice of an action is governed by the agent's **policy**, denoted as:

π(a | s)


This is the probability of taking action `a` given state `s`.

There are two major types of policies:
- **Deterministic Policy**: Always chooses the same action for a given state: `π(s) = a`
- **Stochastic Policy**: Outputs a probability distribution over actions: `π(a | s) = probability`


### Role of Action in the RL Loop

At each time step `t`:
1. The agent observes the current state `sₜ`.
2. It selects an action `aₜ` based on its policy.
3. The environment transitions to a new state `sₜ₊₁` and returns a reward `rₜ₊₁`.

This interaction is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):



(sₜ, aₜ) → (rₜ₊₁, sₜ₊₁)


The agent learns by adjusting its action-selection strategy to improve future rewards.



## Exploration vs Exploitation

Choosing actions involves balancing:
- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover their effects.
- **Exploitation**: Choosing actions known to yield high rewards.

Common strategies include:
- **ε-greedy**: With probability ε choose a random action, otherwise choose the best-known action.
- **Softmax**: Choose actions probabilistically based on their estimated value.


### Action and the Q-Function

In value-based methods like Q-learning, the action-value function `Q(s, a)` represents the expected return from taking action `a` in state `s` and following the optimal policy thereafter.

The optimal action is:

a* = argmax_a Q(s, a)


---

## Summary

- An action is a decision the agent makes to influence the environment.
- Actions can be discrete or continuous.
- The agent selects actions according to a policy, with the goal of maximizing cumulative reward.
- The choice of actions directly influences learning and performance.
- Balancing exploration and exploitation is essential for effective learning.

## Reward 

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the **reward** is a scalar feedback signal that tells the agent how good or bad its action was in a given state. The goal of the agent is to maximize the total cumulative reward it receives over time.

The reward function defines the learning objective and drives the agent’s behaviour.


### Definition

Formally, the reward is denoted as:

rₜ = R(sₜ, aₜ, sₜ₊₁)


Where:
- `sₜ` is the current state at time `t`
- `aₜ` is the action taken at time `t`
- `sₜ₊₁` is the resulting next state
- `rₜ` is the reward received after transitioning to `sₜ₊₁`

The reward is generated by the environment and is immediately received after taking an action.


### Purpose of the Reward

The reward serves the following purposes:
- Provides **feedback** to the agent
- Guides the **learning** of the agent’s policy
- Defines the **objective** (maximize expected cumulative reward)



### Types of Rewards

#### 1. Immediate Reward

A single scalar value received after each action:
```python
reward = env.step(action)[1]
```

#### 2. Delayed Reward
Sometimes the reward is only obtained after a series of steps. This makes learning more difficult and requires credit assignment over time.

Cumulative Reward
The agent seeks to maximize return, which is the total accumulated reward. In episodic tasks:

Gₜ = rₜ₊₁ + rₜ₊₂ + rₜ₊₃ + ... + r_T


Gₜ = rₜ₊₁ + γ * rₜ₊₂ + γ² * rₜ₊₃ + ...

Where:

Gₜ is the return at time t

γ ∈ [0, 1] is the discount factor


Reward Function Design
Designing the reward function is critical:

Sparse rewards (e.g., +1 only at goal) are hard to learn from.

Shaped rewards (e.g., distance to goal) help guide learning but may introduce bias.

Badly designed rewards can cause undesirable or unintended behaviour.


Sample Code:
```python
import gym
# Create environment
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
state = env.reset()

total_reward = 0

for t in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    
    total_reward += reward
    state = next_state
    
    if done:
        break

print("Total reward received:", total_reward)
```

In this example:

The agent interacts with the CartPole environment.

After each action, it receives a reward.

The total reward is accumulated over the episode.

Summary:

The reward is the central feedback signal in RL.

It helps the agent learn which actions are desirable.

The agent's objective is to maximize cumulative rewards.

Designing an effective reward function is crucial for successful learning.



## Episode i
In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an **episode** is a complete sequence of interactions between the agent and the environment, starting from an initial state and ending in a terminal state.

An episode represents one trial or run of the agent in the environment and typically resets once it reaches a defined end condition.



### Definition

An episode is a sequence:

s₀, a₀, r₁, s₁, a₁, r₂, ..., s_T



Where:
- `s₀` is the initial state
- `a₀` is the action taken at time 0
- `r₁` is the reward received after taking `a₀`
- `s₁` is the next state
- ...
- `s_T` is the terminal state at the end of the episode

Once the terminal state is reached, the environment resets and a new episode begins.


### Characteristics of an Episode

- **Finite duration**: Episodes have a beginning and an end.
- **Terminal condition**: The episode ends when the agent reaches a goal, fails, or exceeds a maximum number of steps.
- **Episodic tasks**: Problems that naturally divide into episodes (e.g., games, robotic tasks).
- **Continuing tasks**: Environments with no terminal states, often modeled with discount factors.


### Purpose of Episodes

Episodes help in:
- Measuring the agent's performance per trial
- Structuring training into cycles of experience
- Computing cumulative reward over a run
- Resetting the environment to diversify experience



## Sample Code Example (OpenAI Gym)

```python
import gym

# Create environment
env = gym.make("MountainCar-v0")

num_episodes = 5

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    step = 0

    while not done:
        action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        
        total_reward += reward
        state = next_state
        step += 1

    print(f"Episode {episode + 1}: Total Reward = {total_reward}, Steps = {step}")
```
Explanation:

The environment runs for 5 episodes.

Each episode resets with env.reset().

It runs until done = True, indicating the end of the episode.

The total reward and number of steps are recorded per episode.



Summary
An episode is a full trajectory from the start to a terminal state.

It structures learning into finite experiences.

Episodes are used to measure performance and train agents in bounded environments.

They are critical for tasks where the environment must reset after reaching a goal or failure.
