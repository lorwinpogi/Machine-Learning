# Machine Learning: Introduction to Time Series

## Time Series Forecasting Introduction

### Overview
Francesca Lazari presents on **machine learning for time series forecasting using Python**, drawing on her extensive experience at Microsoft. 

### Time Dimension and Structure
The **time dimension** adds both:
- **Constraints** (e.g., temporal ordering, autocorrelation)
- **Structural information** (e.g., seasonality, trends)

When properly leveraged, this structure can significantly **improve model performance**.

### Analysis vs. Forecasting
- **Time series analysis** aims to understand historical data and its underlying processes.  
- **Time series forecasting**, on the other hand, focuses on **predicting future outcomes** using historical data—a task often referred to as **extrapolation** in classical statistics.

Machine learning techniques are especially powerful for **forecasting tasks**, particularly when traditional models struggle with high dimensionality or nonlinearity.

### Data Transformation for ML
Transforming time series data into a **supervised learning format** is a critical preprocessing step. This typically involves:
- Using a **sliding window approach** to generate input-output pairs  
- Feeding **historical values as input** to predict **future values**, even for **single-step forecasting**

This transformation enables the application of powerful machine learning models to temporal data.

### Importance of Time Series Data
She emphasizes the **importance of time series data** across various industries, highlighting its relevance in areas such as finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing.

### Python Ecosystem for Time Series Forecasting

Core Python libraries for time series data manipulation include tools from the **SciPy ecosystem**, such as:
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **Pandas**, **Statsmodels**, and **scikit-learn** for time series-specific functionality and machine learning modeling

### Key Role of Pandas
**Pandas** plays a central role in time series analysis, with support for:
- **Time-related data types**: `datetime`, `timedelta`, `timespan`, and `date offset`
- Operations like:
  - **Seasonal adjustments**
  - **Time zone conversions**
  - **Datetime indexing and slicing**

These capabilities make it essential for effective **time series preprocessing**.

### Initial Data Handling Workflow
Before modeling, typical steps include:
- **Loading datasets** (e.g., from CSV or databases)
- **Querying by date/time** to filter or aggregate
- **Computing summary statistics**
- **Feature engineering** to extract time-based features (e.g., day of week, lag values, rolling averages)

This preprocessing pipeline ensures the data is structured for both classical and machine learning-based time series forecasting.

### Building End-to-End Time Series Forecasting Solutions

Beyond modeling, developing an **end-to-end forecasting system** involves several key phases:
- **Business understanding** to define objectives and constraints  
- **Data preparation**, including:
  - Time-aware preprocessing
  - **Feature engineering** (lags, rolling stats, seasonal indicators)  
- **Model training** using classical or machine learning models  
- **Deployment** and **scoring** in production environments  
- **Retraining pipelines** to update models with new data  
- **Delivery of predictions** through user-friendly interfaces like dashboards or automated reports

### Forecasting Lifecycle Integration
A well-integrated development cycle ensures that forecasting efforts result in **practical, deployable solutions**—not just isolated experiments. This approach is essential for real-world **industry applications**, where model relevance and adaptability over time are crucial.

### Classical Autoregressive Models for Time Series Forecasting

ARIMA (**AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average**) models are built from three core components:

| **Model Component** | **Description** | **Role in ARIMA** |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Autoregressive (AR) | Uses dependence between an observation and lagged values | Defines lag order (*p*) |
| Moving Average (MA) | Models dependence between an observation and residual errors | Defines order of moving average (*q*) |
| Integrated (I)      | Applies differencing to make the series stationary | Defines degree of differencing (*d*) |

ARIMA models combine these elements to:
- **Capture autocorrelations**
- **Remove trends or seasonality**
- **Forecast future values** effectively in stationary or transformed series

### Implementing ARIMA in Python
The `statsmodels` library provides a user-friendly interface for ARIMA modeling. Key steps include:
- Defining the model using `(p, d, q)` parameters  
- Fitting it to training data  
- Generating forecasts with simple function calls like `model.fit()` and `model.predict()`

This makes ARIMA both powerful and accessible for applied forecasting tasks.

### Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting

**Deep learning**, a subset of machine learning, excels when applied to **large labeled datasets**. Unlike classical machine learning models that require **manual feature engineering**, deep learning can **automatically learn hierarchical features** directly from raw data.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are particularly effective for time series forecasting because:
- They contain **feedback loops**, enabling the network to **retain information from previous time steps**
- They **capture temporal dependencies** that feed-forward neural networks cannot model effectively

This makes RNNs well-suited for sequential data such as financial prices, sensor readings, or energy consumption trends.

### Key RNN Concepts
- **Weighted Inputs**: Each input is multiplied by a weight and combined with a bias term  
- **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: Weights and biases are adjusted through an extended form of backpropagation that spans across time steps to **minimize prediction error**  
- **Hidden State**: A memory structure that:
  - Carries information from past inputs
  - Propagates through each time step
  - Allows the network to use **past context** for **current predictions**

These mechanisms make deep learning models, especially RNN variants like **LSTM** and **GRU**, powerful tools for time series forecasting tasks where long-term dependencies matter.

### Practical Approach
Lazari offers insights from her recent book, which serves as a **practical guide** rather than a theoretical exposition, making it accessible for practitioners and applied data scientists.

### Session Highlights
The session will cover:
- **Fundamental concepts** in time series forecasting  
- **Autoregressive methods** like ARIMA and SARIMA  
- **Deep learning techniques** including RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers  
- **Deployment strategies** for operationalizing forecasting models

This presentation is ideal for professionals looking to build, evaluate, and deploy time series forecasting models using modern machine learning tools.
